    <h3>Adding Sounds to Audio Panel</h3>
    <div>
        To add sounds to the Audio Panel you must first obtain, or create, sounds in the MP3, OGG and AAC formats for 
        the audio engine that is used.  It requires this to ensure compatibility with many different browsers.  Even if
        you only use one browser, the engine believes that it needs to support many different ones.<br><br>

        Once you have obtained the sound file in the various formats, you will need to copy the files to the following
        directory on the bot host:<br>
        <pre>&lt;bot directory&gt;/web/panel/js/ion-sound/sounds/</pre>

        Then, modify the following file on the bot host:<br>
        <pre>&lt;bot directory&gt;/web/panel/js/audioPanel.js</pre>

        Modify the <i>sounds</i> array in the file, you will need to enter the base file <i>name</i> to let the engine
        know which file to look for, note that this does not include .mp3 or .ogg or .aac - simply provide the base of 
        the file name without an extension.  You must also provide a <i>desc</i>ription to be be displayed on the Audio
        Panel page. Simply create a new line in the format, as shown below:<br>
        <pre>{ name: "sound_file",    desc: "A Random Sound" },</pre>
        Once you have added your sound, or sounds, restart the PhantomBot Control Panel.
