You may copy any of the lang files into this directory, matching
the subdirectories if you desire, or just placing all of the files
in this directory.  You may then edit the files and PhantomBot will
override the default language settings with the ones you provide
here.  This allows you to customize your language settings and
not have them overwritten during a release.
