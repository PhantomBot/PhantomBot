/*
 * Rules on writing your own adventure story:
 *
 * - Stories are automatically loaded from this file by their sequence number (adventuresystem.stories.[This number]).
 * - Keep the format of your story as shown above.
 * - There can be an unlimited number of stories, IF you keep their subsequence numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
 * - A story must have a title.
 * - A story can have an unlimited number of chapters, IF you keep their subsequence numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
 * - Stories are picked at random.
 *
 ** Game specific story how-to. You also need to make sure that you at least have ONE story that doesn't require a specific game.
 ** Please make sure that your story number also follow along. What I mean by that is it needs to start from 1 and go up. Same with the chapters.
 * - Add $.lang.register('adventuresystem.stories.NUMBER.game', 'GAME NAME IN LOWER CASE'); on top of the story chapter.

 * Example >
 * $.lang.register('adventuresystem.stories.5.game', 'programming');
 * $.lang.register('adventuresystem.stories.5.title', 'Talk Shows');
 * $.lang.register('adventuresystem.stories.5.chapter.1', 'random story...');
 *
 * Underneath is a template for your first custom story, just remove the preceding slashes.
