## Custom API and Custom API JSON:
To  allow for a great deal of flexibility with PhantomBot, we are happy to provide new  tags for custom commands.

### Custom API:

`!addcom` tag: **(customapi URL)**
*URL*  may contain *$1...$9* to pass parameters from chat as input to the URL.
The **customapi**  tag will pull a given URL and display the information exactly as it is provided  by the web service. This is useful for web services that return plain text. Do not  use this to return data from a web page, as that will simply spam the chat. Note  that the **URL** may be passed parameters from chat, for example, say a web service  requires a text field to return data, such as a name of a person:

`!addcom joke  (customapi http://not.real.com/joke.php?name=$1)`
This would send a request and  pass *name* with a value given as the first parameter to *!joke* in chat. Note that  if a *$1...$9* parameter is given, the bot will require parameters before executing  the command.

### Custom API JSON:

`!addcom` tag: **(customapijson URL key  | object.key | object.object...key | {literal string} ...)**
*URL* may contain  *$1...$9* to pass parameters from chat as input to the URL.
*key* is a key to data  on the first node of the returned JSON
*object.key* provides a JSON object to select  a key from.
*object.object...key* indicates that many objects may be traversed  to get at a given key.
*{literal string}* is text to place between queried values.

The  **customapijson** tag will pull a given URL and expects to receive a JSON object  from the web service. An understanding of JSON objects is highly recommended in  order to know what to use as the mapping guide. Note that the JSON parser will not  attempt to traverse arrays and find specific elements, this will only select objects  and a key. The key must relate to an integer or string value. The following is an  example:
!addcom yomomma (customapijson http://api.yomomma.info/ joke)`

The  above will create a new command that queries the given API and returns the value  associated with the <em>joke</em> key.

#### Another example:
(customapijson  http://api.apixu.com/v1/current.json?key=NOT_PROVIDED&q=$1 {Weather for} location.name  {:} current.condition.text {Temps:} current.temp_f {F} current.temp_c {C})`

The  above will create a new command that queries the given API and requires a parameter  to be given in to the command. In this instance, a weather API is queried and the  return string will be:
**Weather for city name**: *(current weather)*
**Temps**:  *Temp in F, Temp in C*

#### To step through a bit further:
*location.name* parses  the top level <em>location</em> object and then returns the value associated with  the *name* key.
*current.condition.text* parses the top level *current* object  and then moves to the *condition* object to return the value associated with the  *text* key.
*current.temp_f and current_temp_c* parse the top level *current* object  and return the value associated with the given keys, *temp_f* and *temp_c*.
*{Weather  for}, {:}, {Temps:}, {F} and {C}* are literal strings that are printed out.

Please  note again, that this is a simple implementation for parsing JSON data. If a more  complex JSON is to be parsed or data is to be correlated in some way, then a custom  script or Java module would need to be developed.
