# StreamLabs Integration Setup

To setup StreamLabs alerts, go to your bot console (black window) and type `streamlabssetup` and hit enter. Follow the instructions on-screen.

**NOTE:** This integration will only read **donations** from the StreamLabs API.

**NOTE:** Due to the nature of the console, it may scroll away and display more text as you are typing the requested info. Do not worry as the text you already typed is still saved in the input buffer, you can continue typing normally.

**NOTE:** This procedure only works in _interactive_ mode, Linux/macOS users who are running the bot as a daemon/service will have to stop the bot and then run it using _launch.sh_ from SSH or a Terminal. Once the procedure is complete, you can switch back to using the daemon/service. Windows users should already be in _interactive_ mode.

You can now Enable your *StreamLabs Alerts* under *Alerts*.
