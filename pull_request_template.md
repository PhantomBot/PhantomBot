Thank you for contributing to PhantomBot! Hopefully you followed the code style guide:
https://github.com/PhantomBot/PhantomBot/blob/master/CODESTYLE.md

If you added in code from a third party, it must have a license that is compatible with PhantomBot.  If it is not, we will reject the merge request.  The development team takes this very seriously.  If you add in access to an API and PhantomBot would use that API improperly, we will reject the merge request.  Again, the development team takes this very seriously.

You must provide test results for your change.  If test results are not provided we will either, ask you for test results or just reject the change.  

We reserve the right to reject a change for any reason at all.  Typically, we will provide a reason but if we do not, that is at our discretion.  There are some reasons for which we will reject changes, other than the ones given above (but they will be repeated):

- Code style does not match.
- Incompatible license/improper use of license of third party software/API.
- No test results.
- Potential performance issues.
- Design changes that go against the core design philosophy.
- Items with potential to spam or consume the outgoing message queue.
- Poorly architected items.

You are not to harass the development team if a pull request is rejected.
