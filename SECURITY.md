## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities on our Discord. Please just simply state that you have discovered a security vulnerability, as well as a brief, generic description of the vulnerability, if it is safe to do so.

We also accept submissions via email: **security** /A\T/ phantombot // hopto \\ org

We will try our best to reach out to you quickly, confirm the issue, reproduce it, and work on a fix.

If you are able to contribute a fix yourself, we would appreciate it, but it is not required.

We ask that you not reveal the details of exploiting the vulnerability until we have had time to release a fix and allowed sufficient time for users to update.
