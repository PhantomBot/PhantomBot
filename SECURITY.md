## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities on our Discord. Please just simply state that you have discovered a security vulnerability, as well as a brief, generic description of the vulnerability, if it is safe to do so.

We will try our best to reach out to you quickly, confirm the issue, reproduce it, and work on a fix.

If you are able to contribute a fix yourself, we would appreciate it, but it is not required.

We ask that you not reveal the details of exploiting the vulnerability until we have had time to release a fix and allowed sufficient time for users to update.
